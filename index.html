<p><font color="black"> Algebra is one of the broad parts of mathematics, 
   together with number theory, geometry and analysis. in its most generak form, 
   algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating 
   these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics.</font></p>

 <h1> <font color="lightblue">Slope Intercept Form</font></h1>
    <p><font color="black"> In equation pf straight 
   line(when the equation is written as "y=mx+b"), the slope is the number 
   "m" that is multiplied on the x, and "b" is the y-intercept, where 
   the line acrosses the y-axis. This useful form of the line equation is 
   sensibly named the "slope intercept form".</font></p>
